## Overview

This document provides comprehensive security operations procedures for the AIW3 NFT system, focusing on critical key management, security protocols, and operational safeguards required for production deployment.

### Critical Dependencies

The AIW3 NFT system's security is fundamentally dependent on the protection and availability of cryptographic keys that establish authenticity and enable minting operations.

## System Key Management & Security

### Critical Key Dependencies

The AIW3 NFT system relies on **cryptographic keys** that are essential for system operation:

**Primary System Wallet**
- **Purpose**: Creator verification, NFT minting authority
- **Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Loss breaks entire ecosystem
- **Usage**: Signs all minting transactions, establishes creator authenticity

### Key Security Threats & Impact

| Threat Scenario | Impact | Recovery Complexity | Prevention Strategy |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Private Key Loss** | Complete system shutdown | üî¥ **Impossible** | Multi-location secure backup |
| **Private Key Theft** | Unauthorized minting, reputation damage | üü° **Complex** | Hardware security modules |
| **Key Corruption** | Transaction failures | üü¢ **Moderate** | Backup restoration |
