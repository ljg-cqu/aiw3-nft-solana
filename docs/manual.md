# AIW3 NFT on Solana - Business Process and Rules Manual

This document details the business processes and rules for the AIW3 NFT on Solana project, as extracted from the project prototypes.

## 1. Overview of Tiered NFTs

AIW3 Tiered NFTs are a series of NFTs with different levels that serve as a user's identity credential on the AIW3 platform. Holding higher-level NFTs grants users more platform benefits and privileges.

## 2. NFT Levels, Benefits, and Acquisition

There are 6 levels of NFTs, each with unique benefits and acquisition methods.

| Level | Name        | How to Get                                                     | Benefits                                                                      |

## 3. Synthesis Process

Synthesizing is the primary method for upgrading to a higher-level NFT (from Lv.2 to Lv.5).

### Rules:
- **Materials:** To synthesize a target NFT, a user must hold a specific number of lower-level NFTs.
- **Fee:** A synthesis fee must be paid in platform tokens (e.g., AIW3 tokens).
- **Success Rate:** The synthesis process is not guaranteed to succeed. The success rate is displayed to the user before they start the process (e.g., 80% for Lv.2).
- **Failure:** If synthesis fails, the consumed material NFTs and the synthesis fee are lost and not returned to the user.

### Example Flow (Synthesizing Lv.2 NFT):
1.  The user navigates to the Synthesis page.
2.  The target is set to "Lv.2 NFT".
3.  The system checks if the user has the required materials: 3 Lv.1 NFTs.
4.  The system displays the required fee (e.g., 100 AIW3) and the success rate (e.g., 80%).
5.  The user initiates the synthesis.
6.  On success, the user receives a Lv.2 NFT, and the 3 Lv.1 NFTs and fee are consumed.
7.  On failure, the 3 Lv.1 NFTs and fee are consumed, and the user does not receive the Lv.2 NFT.

## 4. NFT Activation and Display

- **Activation:** After acquiring a new NFT, users may be prompted to "activate" it to begin receiving the associated benefits.
- **Profile Display:** The user's current NFT level is displayed as a badge on their profile and mini-profile within the community.
- **Personal Center:** Users can view their entire collection of NFTs in their Personal Center.

## 5. NFT Trading

AIW3 Tiered NFTs are tradable on any Solana-compatible NFT marketplace.
