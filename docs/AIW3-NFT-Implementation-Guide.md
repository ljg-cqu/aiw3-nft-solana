## Standard Solana Programs Integration

The AIW3 NFT system uses **only standard Solana programs** without requiring any custom smart contract development. This approach leverages battle-tested blockchain functionality while eliminating development complexity and security risks.

### 1. **Standard Program Dependencies**
- **Action:** Integrate with existing Solana programs using standard libraries and SDKs.
  - **SPL Token Program:** Use for all NFT minting, burning, and transfer operations
  - **Metaplex Token Metadata Program:** Use for NFT metadata management and creator verification
  - **Associated Token Account Program:** Use for user wallet NFT storage
- **Rationale:** Using standard programs eliminates custom development complexity, reduces security risks, and ensures compatibility with the entire Solana ecosystem.

### 2. **Backend Business Logic Implementation**
- **Action:** Implement all business rules in the backend service layer, not on-chain.
  - **Level Verification:** Backend verifies user qualifications before authorizing minting operations
  - **Upgrade Logic:** Backend orchestrates the burn-and-mint process using standard token operations
  - **Access Control:** Backend controls system wallet operations and user authorization
- **Rationale:** Off-chain business logic provides flexibility for rule changes while on-chain operations remain simple and standard.

### 3. **Security Through Standard Programs**
- **Action:** Leverage the security of battle-tested standard Solana programs.
  - **Proven Security:** SPL Token and Metaplex programs have been extensively audited and tested
  - **Access Controls:** Use standard token authority patterns for secure operations
  - **No Custom Attack Vectors:** Eliminates security risks from custom smart contract code
- **Rationale:** Standard programs provide enterprise-grade security without the risks and costs of custom smart contract development and auditing.

### 4. **Integration Testing and Deployment**
- **Action:** Test integration with standard Solana programs and deploy backend services.
  - **Standard Program Integration Tests:** Test interactions with SPL Token and Metaplex programs
  - **Backend Service Tests:** Test business logic and standard program interactions
  - **Deployment Scripts:** Automate backend service deployment and configuration
- **Rationale:** Testing focuses on integration with proven standard programs rather than custom contract logic, reducing complexity and risk.

## Backend Services

The backend is the intermediary between the user-facing frontend and the standard Solana programs.

### 1. **Standard Program Integration**
- **Action:** Integrate with existing Solana programs using standard libraries and SDKs.
  - **SPL Token Program:** Use for all NFT minting, burning, and transfer operations.
  - **Metaplex Token Metadata:** Use for NFT metadata management and creator verification.
  - **Associated Token Account Program:** Use for user wallet NFT storage.
- **Rationale:** Using standard programs eliminates custom development complexity, reduces security risks, and ensures compatibility with the entire Solana ecosystem.

### 2. **API Endpoint Creation & Frontend Integration**
- **Action:** Develop a comprehensive REST API with standardized endpoints and real-time communication for seamless frontend integration.

#### Core API Endpoints
  - `GET /api/nft/status`: Returns user's current NFT, qualification progress, and benefits with standardized JSON format
  - `POST /api/nft/claim`: Initiates first NFT claim with transaction status tracking and WebSocket progress events
  - `POST /api/nft/upgrade`: Executes burn-and-mint upgrade process with multi-step progress tracking
  - `GET /api/nft/benefits`: Returns current benefits and fee reductions
  - `GET /api/nft/badges`: Returns user's badge collection with unlock status
  - `POST /api/nft/badges/claim`: Claims new badges affecting upgrade qualification

#### Frontend Integration Features
  - **Standardized Response Format**: Consistent success/error responses following existing `lastmemefi-api` patterns
  - **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket events (`nft:status_changed`, `nft:upgrade_progress`, `nft:qualification_updated`, `nft:transaction_status`)
  - **Transaction Tracking**: Solana transaction signatures returned for frontend monitoring
  - **Authentication**: Integration with existing JWT middleware from `AccessTokenService`
  - **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with technical details for debugging

#### API Documentation & Testing Support
  - **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI at `/docs/nft` with live examples
  - **Mock Data**: Sandbox endpoints with `/api/nft/sandbox/` prefix for development
  - **Code Examples**: JavaScript, React, Vue.js integration samples
  - **Client SDK**: JavaScript library for easy WebSocket and API integration

- **Rationale:** Comprehensive API design with frontend integration support ensures seamless end-to-end functionality and developer productivity.

### 3. **Solana Integration**
- **Action:** Use the `@solana/web3.js` library to communicate with the Solana network.
  - **RPC Communication:** Connect to a Solana RPC node to read on-chain data and submit transactions.
  - **Standard Operations:** Use SPL Token Program instructions for minting, burning, and transferring NFTs.
  - **Metadata Management:** Use Metaplex Token Metadata Program for NFT metadata operations.
- **Rationale:** Direct integration with standard Solana programs allows the backend to verify on-chain state and execute transactions without custom smart contract complexity.

### 4. **Monitoring Service**
- **Action:** Develop a background service to monitor the blockchain for relevant events.
  - **Event Listener:** Use WebSocket connections to listen for `Mint` and `Burn` events related to the NFT collection.
  - **Database Updates:** Update the `nft_ownership` cache table in real-time as events occur.
- **Rationale:** A monitoring service ensures that the off-chain database remains synchronized with the on-chain state, providing users with an accurate and up-to-date view of their assets.

## Frontend Application

The frontend is the user's primary interface for interacting with the AIW3 NFT system.

### 1. **UI/UX Mockup Translation**
- **Action:** Convert the static prototype images into interactive UI components using a framework like React or Vue.
  - **Personal Center:** A dashboard displaying the user's current NFT, benefits, and progress.
  - **Synthesis Flow:** A step-by-step modal or page that guides the user through the process of unlocking a new tier.
- **Rationale:** A clean and intuitive UI is essential for a positive user experience, especially for complex processes like NFT upgrades.

### 2. **Wallet Integration**
- **Action:** Integrate a wallet adapter library (e.g., `@solana/wallet-adapter`).
  - **Supported Wallets:** Add support for popular wallets like Phantom, Solflare, and Backpack.
  - **Connection Management:** Handle wallet connection, disconnection, and account change events.
- **Rationale:** Wallet integration is the foundation of any dApp, allowing users to securely manage their keys and sign transactions.

### 3. **Component Development**
- **Action:** Build the core React/Vue components that make up the user interface.
  - `NftCard`: A reusable component to display an NFT's image, name, and level.
  - `ProgressBar`: A visual indicator of the user's progress toward the next tier's trading volume requirement.
  - `BenefitList`: A component that dynamically displays the benefits associated with the user's current NFT tier.
- **Rationale:** A component-based architecture promotes code reuse and makes the application easier to maintain and scale.

### 4. **API Integration**
- **Action:** Connect the frontend components to the backend REST API.
  - **Data Fetching:** Use a library like `axios` or `fetch` to call the `GET` endpoints and display the data.
  - **Transaction Submission:** When a user initiates an upgrade, call the `POST` endpoint to have the backend construct and submit the on-chain transaction.
- **Rationale:** API integration links the user interface to the underlying business logic, creating a fully functional application.

## NFT Upgrade and Burn Strategy

This section outlines the recommended strategy for handling NFT upgrades, focusing on a **Burn-and-Mint** model to ensure system integrity and prevent duplicate benefits.

### Recommended Model: Burn-and-Mint

The most secure and straightforward approach is to require the user to **burn** their lower-level NFT before the system **mints** the new, higher-level NFT.

**Key Advantages:**
- **Prevents Double-Dipping:** It is impossible for a user to hold two different levels of Equity NFTs simultaneously, ensuring they cannot claim benefits from both.
- **Atomic State Transition:** The state change is clear and unambiguous. The user either has the old NFT or the new one, never both.
- **Simplified Auditing:** It is easy to verify on-chain that the old NFT was destroyed before the new one was created.

### Alternative Model (Not Recommended): In-Place Update

An alternative would be to have a mutable NFT whose metadata is updated by the system. This is **not recommended** for the following reasons:
- **Breaks Immutability:** It violates the core principle that NFTs should be immutable records.
- **Complex and Error-Prone:** Would require custom smart contract development with authority to modify NFT metadata, which is more complex and introduces potential security risks. Our approach avoids this entirely by using standard programs.
- **Poor Ecosystem Compatibility:** Many wallets and marketplaces are not designed to handle NFTs whose metadata changes, which could lead to display issues or user confusion.

### Burn-and-Mint Workflow

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant SolanaProgram

    User->>Frontend: Clicks "Upgrade NFT"
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /api/nft/initiate-upgrade
    Backend->>Backend: Verify user meets off-chain requirements (e.g., trading volume)
    alt Requirements Met
        Backend->>Frontend: Return signed "Burn" transaction
        Frontend->>User: Prompt to approve Burn transaction
        User->>SolanaProgram: Approves and sends transaction
        SolanaProgram->>SolanaProgram: Burns the old NFT
        Note over Backend,SolanaProgram: Backend monitors for Burn confirmation
        Backend->>SolanaProgram: Calls `mint_new_nft(level)`
        SolanaProgram->>SolanaProgram: Mints the new, higher-level NFT to user's wallet
        SolanaProgram-->>User: New NFT appears in wallet
    else Requirements Not Met
        Backend-->>Frontend: Return error message
        Frontend-->>User: Display "You are not eligible for an upgrade"
    end
```

### User Experience Considerations

- **Clear Communication:** The UI must clearly explain to the user that their old NFT will be permanently destroyed as part of the upgrade process.
- **Two-Step Approval:** The user should be required to approve two separate actions:
  1.  An initial confirmation in the UI (e.g., a checkbox saying, "I understand my Lv.1 NFT will be burned").
  2.  The final transaction approval in their wallet.
- **Transaction Status Tracking:** The frontend should provide real-time feedback on the status of the burn and mint transactions, so the user is not left wondering what is happening.
