# AIW3 NFT Tiers and Rules

## Executive Summary

This document defines the official tiers, benefits, and operational policies for the AIW3 NFT collection. It serves as the single source of truth for business rules governing NFT qualification, synthesis (upgrading), and the associated user benefits. All system components, from the `lastmemefi-api` backend (located at `/home/zealy/aiw3/gitlab.com/lastmemefi-api`) to the frontend UI, must adhere to these policies.

## üìú Guiding Principles

-   **Fairness**: Qualification is based purely on verifiable trading activity.
-   **Transparency**: All rules and benefits are publicly documented.
-   **Exclusivity**: Higher tiers offer increasingly valuable and exclusive benefits.
-   **Data Source**: A user's qualification for an NFT tier is determined *exclusively* by aggregating their total trading volume from the `Trades` model in the `lastmemefi-api` database. There is no `total_trading_volume` field on the `User` model itself.

## üìä NFT Tiers and Qualification Rules

Qualification for each NFT tier is based on a user's total trading volume, calculated in USDT. The levels range from 1 to 5, with an additional Special tier.
