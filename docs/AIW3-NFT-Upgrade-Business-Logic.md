## üéØ Overview

This document defines the business logic requirements for AIW3's equity NFT upgrade process. Unlike simple NFT collections, AIW3 equity NFTs control access to real business benefits and rights, requiring sophisticated verification workflows to maintain system integrity.

**Key Principles:**
- **Atomic Operations**: Upgrades must be verifiably complete before new benefits activate
- **Merit-Based Access**: Users must demonstrate platform engagement through transaction volume
- **System Integrity**: Prevent double-claiming and unauthorized access to higher tiers
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure proper transfer of equity rights without duplication

## üîÑ Upgrade Challenge & Requirements

### üéØ The Equity NFT Upgrade Challenge

AIW3 equity NFTs represent tiered access rights and benefits. When users upgrade from a lower-level NFT to a higher-level one, the system must ensure:

1. **Old NFT Rights Are Revoked**: The burned NFT should immediately stop providing benefits
2. **No Double Benefits**: Users cannot claim benefits from both old and new NFTs during transition
3. **Atomic Upgrades**: The upgrade process should be verifiably complete before new benefits activate
4. **Transaction Volume Requirements**: Users must meet minimum transaction volume thresholds on the AIW3 platform to qualify for each NFT level

## üîç System Verification Workflow

To maintain system integrity, the upgrade process follows a strict, multi-stage verification workflow based on defined business rules.

### üõ°Ô∏è Core Verification Requirements

The system must verify multiple conditions before authorizing an NFT upgrade:

- **Transaction Volume**: The user's cumulative transaction volume must meet or exceed the threshold for the target NFT level.
- **Platform Engagement**: For higher levels, the user must possess the required number of designated badge-type NFTs.
- **Burn-Before-Mint**: To prevent duplicate benefits, the user's old NFT must be verifiably burned and its token account closed before the new NFT is minted.

### üîÑ High-Level Upgrade Process

From a business perspective, the user journey for an upgrade is as follows:

1.  **Eligibility Check**: The user initiates an eligibility check. The system calculates their transaction volume and checks for required badge NFTs against the rules defined in this document.
2.  **Upgrade Initiation**: If eligible, the user is prompted to approve the upgrade, which begins by burning their current-level NFT.
3.  **Burn Verification**: The AIW3 system monitors the blockchain to confirm that the user's old NFT has been successfully burned. This is a mandatory prerequisite for proceeding.
4.  **New NFT Issuance**: Once the burn is verified, the system automatically mints the new, higher-level NFT to the user's wallet.
5.  **Benefit Activation**: The new benefits and access rights associated with the higher-level NFT are immediately activated for the user.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Business Considerations

### Why This Matters
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensures equity rights are properly transferred, not duplicated
- **Economic Integrity**: Prevents exploitation of the upgrade system through volume requirements
- **Merit-Based Access**: Only users who demonstrate platform engagement receive higher tiers
- **User Trust**: Demonstrates that the system properly manages digital equity ownership based on actual activity
- **Revenue Protection**: Volume thresholds ensure higher-tier benefits are earned, not gamed
- **Scalability**: Enables confident expansion of the equity NFT program with clear qualification criteria

### Implementation Considerations
- **Volume Calculation Period**: Define whether thresholds are based on all-time, rolling 12-month, or other time periods
- **Volume Types**: Specify which transactions count (trading, staking, lending, etc.)
- **Currency Conversion**: Establish how to handle multi-asset volumes and price conversions
- **Verification Frequency**: Determine how often to re-verify volume requirements for existing NFT holders
- **Grace Periods**: Consider transition periods for users whose volume drops below thresholds
