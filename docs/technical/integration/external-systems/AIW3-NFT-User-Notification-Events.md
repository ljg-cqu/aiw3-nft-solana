# AIW3 NFT User Notification Events for IM Integration

<!-- Document Metadata -->
**Version:** v2.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** Complete specification of NFT system passive asynchronous events that require active user notifications through third-party instant messaging (IM) services

---

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive specification of all **passive asynchronous events** that the AIW3 NFT system needs to actively notify users about through third-party instant messaging (IM) services. These are events that happen automatically based on system monitoring and user activity tracking, where users need to be informed but are not directly participating in the action.

### Passive vs Active Events Classification

**üîÑ Passive Asynchronous Events (Covered in this document):**
- Events that happen automatically based on system monitoring
- Users are NOT actively participating when the event occurs
- System needs to send notifications to inform users
- Examples: NFT upgrade conditions met, trading volume milestones reached, badge eligibility achieved

**‚ö° Active Synchronous Events (NOT covered in this document):**
- Events triggered by direct user actions
- Users are actively participating and get immediate feedback
- No additional notifications needed as users see results immediately
- Examples: Minting NFT, activating badges, upgrading NFT, claiming rewards

### Integration Context
- **Source System**: AIW3 NFT Backend (lastmemefi-api)
- **Event Transport**: Kafka Topics ‚Üí IM Service Integration
- **Target Audience**: End users via their preferred IM platforms
- **Notification Priority**: Real-time delivery for critical events, batched delivery for informational events

---

## Event Categories

### üéØ **Critical Events** (Immediate Delivery)
Events requiring immediate user attention and confirmation.

### ‚≠ê **High Priority Events** (Real-time Delivery)
Important achievements and status changes users want to know about immediately.

### üü° **Medium Priority Events** (Near Real-time Delivery)
Progress updates and informational events that enhance user experience.

### üîµ **Low Priority Events** (Batched Delivery)
System events and analytics that can be delivered in batches.

## Event Delivery Configuration

### Priority-Based Delivery

| Priority Level | Delivery Method | Max Delay | Retry Policy | Batch Size |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| üéØ Critical | Real-time push | < 30 seconds | 3 retries, exponential backoff | 1 |
| ‚≠ê High Priority | Real-time push | < 2 minutes | 2 retries, linear backoff | 1 |
| üü° Medium Priority | Near real-time | < 15 minutes | 1 retry after 5 minutes | 5 |
| üîµ Low Priority | Batched | < 4 hours | No retry | 20 |

### User Preferences

Users should be able to configure notification preferences:

```json
{
  "user_notification_preferences": {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "enabled_events": [
      "nft_unlocked",
      "nft_upgraded", 
      "badge_earned",
      "trading_volume_milestone",
      "competition_nft_airdrop",
      "transaction_failed"
    ],
    "disabled_events": [
      "badge_activated",
      "qualification_status_changed",
      "competition_ranking_update",
      "system_maintenance"
    ],
    "delivery_preferences": {
      "critical_events": "immediate",
      "high_priority_events": "immediate",
      "medium_priority_events": "batched_hourly",
      "low_priority_events": "batched_daily"
    },
    "quiet_hours": {
      "enabled": true,
      "start_time": "22:00",
      "end_time": "08:00",
      "timezone": "UTC"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Integration Implementation

### Kafka Topic Structure

```javascript
// Recommended Kafka topic configuration
const nftNotificationTopics = {
  // Critical events - immediate processing
  'nft-critical-notifications': {
    partitions: 3,
    replication: 3,
    retention: '7 days'
  },
  
  // High priority events - real-time processing  
  'nft-high-priority-notifications': {
    partitions: 6,
    replication: 3,
    retention: '3 days'
  },
  
  // Medium/Low priority events - batched processing
  'nft-batched-notifications': {
    partitions: 12,
    replication: 2,
    retention: '1 day'
  }
};
```

### Event Publishing Pattern

```javascript
// Example event publishing in NFTService
const publishNotificationEvent = async (eventType, userId, eventData, priority = 'medium') => {
  const event = {
    event_type: eventType,
    user_id: userId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    data: eventData,
    priority: priority,
    message_template: getMessageTemplate(eventType, eventData)
  };
  
  const topic = getTopicByPriority(priority);
  await KafkaService.publishMessage(topic, event);
  
  // Log for audit trail
  sails.log.info(`Published ${eventType} notification for user ${userId}`, {
    event_id: event.event_id,
    priority: priority,
    topic: topic
  });
};
```

### IM Service Integration Points

1. **Event Consumer Service**: Consumes events from Kafka topics
2. **Message Formatting Service**: Converts events to IM-specific formats
3. **Delivery Service**: Handles actual message delivery to IM platforms
4. **User Preference Service**: Manages user notification preferences
5. **Retry & Dead Letter Service**: Handles failed deliveries

---

## Testing & Validation

### Event Testing Checklist

- [ ] All event schemas validate against JSON schema
- [ ] Message templates render correctly with sample data
- [ ] Priority-based routing works correctly
- [ ] User preference filtering functions properly
- [ ] Retry mechanisms handle failures gracefully
- [ ] Batching logic groups events correctly
- [ ] Quiet hours are respected
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents spam

### Sample Test Events

Each event type should be tested with:
- ‚úÖ Valid data scenarios
- ‚úÖ Edge case data scenarios  
- ‚úÖ Invalid/malformed data handling
- ‚úÖ User preference filtering
- ‚úÖ Delivery failure scenarios
- ‚úÖ Retry mechanism validation

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Event Publishing Rate | Events/minute by type | > 1000/min |
| Delivery Success Rate | % of successful deliveries | < 95% |
| Average Delivery Time | Time from event to delivery | > 5 minutes |
| User Engagement Rate | % of users interacting with notifications | < 20% |
| Error Rate by Event Type | Failed events by type | > 5% |

### Operational Dashboards

1. **Real-time Event Flow**: Live view of events being published and consumed
2. **Delivery Performance**: Success rates, timing, and failure analysis  
3. **User Engagement**: Click-through rates and user interaction metrics
4. **System Health**: Kafka lag, consumer performance, error rates

---

## Conclusion

This comprehensive specification covers all NFT system events that should be integrated with third-party IM services. The event-driven architecture ensures users receive timely, relevant notifications about their NFT activities while providing flexibility for user preferences and system scalability.

### Key Benefits

- **Complete Coverage**: All NFT lifecycle events captured
- **Priority-Based Delivery**: Critical events get immediate attention
- **User Control**: Comprehensive preference management
- **Scalable Architecture**: Kafka-based event streaming
- **Monitoring Ready**: Built-in metrics and observability
- **IM Platform Agnostic**: Generic event format for any IM integration

For implementation questions or integration support, refer to the [Event-Driven Architecture](../../architecture/AIW3-NFT-Event-Driven-Architecture.md) documentation or contact the development team.
