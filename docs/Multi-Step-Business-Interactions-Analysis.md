### **Critical Multi-Step Characteristics**

1. **Wallet Interaction Dependency**
   - NFT Upgrade, First Unlock, Wallet Connection
   - Requires user to approve blockchain transactions
   - Highest complexity due to external wallet dependencies

2. **Blockchain Transaction Dependencies**
   - NFT operations (mint/burn), Competition airdrops
   - Require transaction confirmation waiting
   - Need retry mechanisms for failed transactions

3. **Real-time Status Updates Required**
   - Most operations except static profile management
   - Essential for user experience during waiting periods
   - HTTP/2 SSE connections critical for performance

4. **State Persistence Requirements**
   - Upgrade requests, airdrop operations
   - Must survive page refreshes and reconnections
   - Database tracking essential for retry capability

5. **Error Recovery Complexity**
   - Multi-point failures possible
   - Different recovery strategies per failure type
   - User guidance needed for resolution steps

---

## 💡 **HTTP/2 SSE Benefits for Multi-Step Interactions**

### **Why These Actions Need Real-Time Communication:**

1. **User Experience**: Users need immediate feedback during blockchain operations
2. **State Synchronization**: Frontend must stay synchronized with backend state changes
3. **Error Handling**: Real-time error notifications enable quick user response
4. **Progress Tracking**: Long operations need progress indicators
5. **Retry Coordination**: Failed operations need coordinated retry mechanisms

### **HTTP/2 SSE Advantages for These Scenarios:**

- **Single Connection Reuse**: All real-time updates use the same long-lived connection
- **Efficient Header Compression**: Authentication tokens compressed across multiple events
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple SSE streams can run simultaneously
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Browser handles connection failures transparently
- **Better Performance**: 3-5x faster than polling for status updates

---

## 📋 **Implementation Recommendations**

### **For Each Multi-Step Process:**

1. **Create Persistent Request Tracking**
   - Database records for operation state
   - Unique request IDs for correlation
   - Status history for debugging

2. **Implement HTTP/2 SSE Streams**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Connection management with limits
   - Graceful error handling

3. **Design Retry/Resume Mechanisms**
   - Identify retryable vs permanent failures
   - State recovery after interruption
   - User-friendly retry interfaces

4. **Provide Clear User Guidance**
   - Progress indicators and status messages
   - Error explanations and resolution steps
   - Expected timing information

5. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Network timeout handling
   - Blockchain confirmation delays
   - Wallet connection issues
   - Recovery path documentation

This analysis shows that the NFT system has **8 major multi-step business interactions**, with NFT Upgrade being the most complex (6+ steps). All require careful frontend-backend coordination, and most benefit significantly from HTTP/2 SSE real-time communication.
