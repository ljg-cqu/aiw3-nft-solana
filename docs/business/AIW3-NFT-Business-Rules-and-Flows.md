## üìú Guiding Principles

-   **Fairness**: Qualification is based purely on verifiable trading activity.
-   **Transparency**: All rules and benefits are publicly documented.
-   **Exclusivity**: Higher tiers offer increasingly valuable and exclusive benefits.

## üìä NFT Tiers, Rules, and Benefits

Qualification for each NFT tier is based on a user's total trading volume, calculated in USDT. The levels range from 1 to 5, with an additional Special tier.

### Qualification Conditions

A user's qualification for an NFT tier is determined by two mandatory conditions:
1.  **Total Trading Volume**: Aggregated from the `Trades` model in the `lastmemefi-api` database.
2.  **Required Badges**: The user must own a specific number of bound badges to be eligible for an upgrade.

Both conditions must be met before a user can claim or upgrade an NFT. There is no `total_trading_volume` field on the `User` model itself; it must always be calculated.

### NFT Tiers, Rules, and Benefits Summary

## üîÑ NFT Operations and Business Flows

This section details the end-to-end user and system processes for managing NFTs, from initial qualification to community display.

### Unlocking and Activation Processes

- **Objective**: Transition an NFT from a potential (unlockable) state to an active, owned state for a user.
- **States**:
    - **Unlockable**: The user has met the criteria to unlock the NFT but has not yet claimed it.
    - **Unlocked**: The user has claimed the NFT, but it is not yet active. This state is visually represented in the Personal Center.
    - **Active**: The user has activated the NFT, and it is now providing benefits.
- **Process**:
    1.  The `NFTService` backend component periodically or on-demand calculates the user's total trading volume.
    2.  If the user qualifies for a new NFT tier, the system creates a `UserNFTQualification` record.
    3.  The frontend, particularly the **Personal Center**, reflects this unlockable status, prompting the user to claim their new NFT.
    4.  Upon user confirmation, the `NFTService` initiates the minting process via `Web3Service`.
    5.  A new `UserNFT` record is created in the database with an `unlocked` status, linking the NFT mint address to the user.
    6.  The user must then perform a final on-chain transaction to activate the NFT, at which point the status is updated to `active`.

### Synthesis and Upgrade Processes

- **Workflow Summary**: The synthesis process follows a "burn-and-mint" strategy to upgrade a user's NFT to the next tier. This ensures a clean, atomic transition and maintains the integrity of the NFT collection.
- **User Interaction**:
    1.  A user who qualifies for a higher tier initiates the upgrade from their **Personal Center**.
    2.  The UI displays a confirmation dialog detailing the NFT that will be burned and the new NFT that will be minted.
    3.  The user approves the transaction, which may require a wallet signature.
- **Backend Process**:
    1.  The `NFTService` validates that the user meets both the trading volume and badge requirements for the target tier.
    2.  It instructs the `Web3Service` to execute a single, atomic transaction that bundles two instructions: one to burn the old NFT and another to mint the new, higher-level NFT.
    3.  An `upgraded` event is published via Kafka.

### User Profiles and Community Views

- **Personal Center**: The central hub for all user interactions with their NFTs, featuring an NFT gallery, an interface for synthesis, and a summary of benefits.
- **Community Visibility**: A user's public-facing profile will display their highest-achieved Equity NFT, fostering engagement and social proof.

### Notifications and Badge Systems

- **System-Wide Alerts**: Real-time alerts (e.g., "Congratulations! You can now claim the Quant Ape NFT.") are powered by Kafka and WebSockets to keep the user informed.
- **Badge Integration**: In addition to the primary NFTs, users can earn special badges. While some are for display, others may be required for upgrading to higher NFT tiers.

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Prototypes

The visual representation for each NFT tier is defined by the official assets located in the `assets/images` directory. Key visual elements related to the tiers and policies include:

-   **Personal Center Dashboards**: Showing locked and unlocked NFT states.
-   **NFT Cards**: Displaying tier, name, and artwork.
-   **Synthesis Flow**: Visualizing the upgrade process.

## Conclusion

By consolidating all business rules and flows into a single document, this guide ensures aligned expectations and precise execution of the NFT concepts across the AIW3 platform.

## Glossary of Terms

-   **Equity NFT:** The primary NFT representing a user's status and benefits, organized into **Levels** or **Tiers**. Higher tiers are acquired by meeting trading volume thresholds and earning the required **badges**.
-   **Badge:** An off-chain achievement marker that acts as a prerequisite or "key" for synthesizing a higher-level **Equity NFT**. These are awarded for specific achievements or participation and are not NFTs themselves.
-   **Synthesis:** The official term for upgrading an Equity NFT. This process consumes the user's current NFT and requires specific **badges** to be earned before a new, higher-level one can be minted.
-   **Unlockable State:** A state where a user has met the criteria to claim an NFT but has not yet minted it. It requires a final user action.
-   **Micro Badge:** A small icon representing a user's highest NFT level, displayed on their profile for status.
-   **Special NFT:** A distinct NFT awarded for special achievements (e.g., winning a competition), acquired via airdrop, not Synthesis. The acquisition flow is typically a direct airdrop managed by the system administrators.
-   **Solana:** The high-performance blockchain network where AIW3 NFTs are built, recorded, and traded. All on-chain operations described in the business flows occur on this network.
