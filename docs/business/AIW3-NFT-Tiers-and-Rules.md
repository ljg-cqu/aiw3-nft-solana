## Executive Summary

This document defines the official tiers, benefits, and operational policies for the AIW3 NFT collection. It serves as the single source of truth for business rules governing NFT qualification, synthesis (upgrading), and the associated user benefits. All system components, from the `lastmemefi-api` backend (located at `$HOME/aiw3/lastmemefi-api`) to the frontend UI, must adhere to these policies.

## üìä NFT Tiers and Qualification Rules

Qualification for each NFT tier is based on a user's total trading volume, calculated in USDT. The levels range from 1 to 5, with an additional Special tier.

### Qualification Conditions

A user's qualification for an NFT tier is determined by two mandatory conditions:
1.  **Total Trading Volume**: Aggregated from the `Trades` model in the `lastmemefi-api` database.
2.  **Required Badges**: The user must own a specific number of bound badges to be eligible for an upgrade.

Both conditions must be met before a user can claim or upgrade an NFT. There is no `total_trading_volume` field on the `User` model itself; it must always be calculated.
