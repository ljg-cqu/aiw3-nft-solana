## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive technical guide for implementing AIW3's Equity NFT system on Solana. The recommended approach uses **system-direct minting** combined with **user-controlled burning**, leveraging the Metaplex Token Metadata standard for maximum ecosystem compatibility.

### Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Authenticity Guaranteed**: Creator verification through on-chain metadata
- ‚úÖ **User Autonomy**: Full user control over NFT ownership and burning
- ‚úÖ **Cost Effective**: No custom smart contracts required
- ‚úÖ **Industry Standard**: Compatible with all major Solana NFT tools

### Strategic Approach

The optimal implementation uses a **hybrid lifecycle pattern** that balances authenticity, user autonomy, and ecosystem compatibility through:
- **System-controlled minting** for authenticity guarantee
- **Partner-driven verification** for ecosystem integration
- **User-controlled burning** for ownership autonomy

---

## NFT Lifecycle Overview

The AIW3 NFT ecosystem operates through three distinct phases:

| Phase | Description | Control | Key Technology |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **üèóÔ∏è MINT** | NFT creation with metadata URI linking to level data | AIW3 System Wallet | Solana Token Program + Metaplex |
| **üîç USE** | Verification and data access by partners | Ecosystem Partners | Metadata queries + IPFS via Pinata |
| **üî• BURN** | NFT destruction for upgrades/exits | User Wallet | User-initiated transactions |

### Lifecycle Characteristics

**Phase 1: Minting (System-Controlled)**
- Images sourced from AIW3 backend `assets/images` directory
- Images uploaded to IPFS via Pinata for decentralized access
- JSON metadata created with IPFS image URIs and level data
- JSON metadata uploaded to IPFS via Pinata
- AIW3 System Wallet mints NFT to user's Associated Token Account (ATA)
- User becomes owner upon transaction confirmation without additional transfer
- Metadata URI points to IPFS-hosted JSON containing level data and image references

**Phase 2: Usage (Partner-Initiated)**
- Partners verify authenticity via on-chain creator field
- Level queried from IPFS-hosted JSON metadata attributes
- Images retrieved directly from IPFS via Pinata gateway

**Phase 3: Burning (User-Controlled)**
- User initiates burn transaction
- Token supply reduced to zero
- Associated Token Account closed
- SOL rent returned to user

---

## Technical Architecture

The AIW3 NFT system uses a hybrid approach where the NFT itself contains only a URI reference to off-chain JSON metadata that stores the actual level data and references to IPFS-hosted images.

### Transaction Volume Qualification

**Qualification Rules**:
The system qualifies users for NFT levels based on a combination of transaction volume and ownership of specific badge-type NFTs. The definitive business rules for each level are maintained in the **AIW3 NFT Tiers and Policies** document.

**Technical Verification Process**:
1. Query user's total transaction volume from MySQL database
2. Determine highest qualified NFT level based on volume thresholds
3. Verify user doesn't already possess NFT of that level or higher
4. Check for any pending minting operations for the user
5. Authorize minting for qualified level only

**Qualification Business Rules**:
- Users can only mint NFTs for levels they have transaction volume to support
- Users cannot mint multiple NFTs of the same level
- Users cannot mint lower-level NFTs if they already possess higher-level ones
- Transaction volume is calculated from all completed transactions in the system
- Real-time volume calculation ensures current qualification status

### Image and Metadata Flow

```
AIW3 Backend assets/images Directory
         ‚Üì (Source Images)
    Upload to IPFS via Pinata
         ‚Üì (Get IPFS Hash)
    Create JSON Metadata with IPFS Image URI
         ‚Üì
    Upload JSON to IPFS via Pinata
         ‚Üì (Get Metadata IPFS Hash)
    Store Metadata URI in On-Chain NFT Metadata
         ‚Üì
    Third-Party Access via IPFS Gateways
```

**Note**: The NFT is minted to the user's Associated Token Account (ATA), which is deterministically derived from the user's wallet address and the NFT mint address. Ownership is established when the minting transaction is confirmed on-chain.

### On-Chain Metadata Account Details

Data stored directly on **Solana blockchain** for trust and authenticity verification:

| Field | Type | Source | Required | Description & AIW3 Usage |
|-------|------|--------|----------|--------------------------|
| `update_authority` | `Pubkey` | AIW3 System Wallet | Yes | AIW3 System Wallet public key |
| `mint` | `Pubkey` | Solana | Yes | NFT's unique identifier |
| `data.name` | `String` | AIW3 System Wallet | Yes | NFT name (e.g., "Tech Chicken", "Quant Ape") |
| `data.symbol` | `String` | AIW3 System Wallet | Yes | Collection symbol (e.g., "AIW3E") |
| `data.uri` | `String` | AIW3 System Wallet | Yes | IPFS via Pinata URI for off-chain JSON |
| `data.creators` | `Vec<Creator>` | AIW3 System Wallet | Yes | **Core authenticity verification** |
| `is_mutable` | `bool` | AIW3 System Wallet | Yes | Set to `false` for permanence |

### Off-Chain JSON Metadata Details

The `uri` field in the on-chain metadata contains an IPFS via Pinata link to this JSON file where the **actual Level data is stored** and **images are referenced via IPFS**:

```json
{
  "name": "On-chain Hunter",
  "symbol": "AIW3E",
  "description": "Represents Level 3 equity and status within the AIW3 ecosystem.",
  "image": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmImageHashExample123",
  "external_url": "https://aiw3.io",
  "attributes": [

      }
    ],

### Frontend Interaction and User Experience

## On-Chain Program Design

This section outlines the high-level architecture of the Solana smart contract (program) that governs the AIW3 Equity NFT system. All operations that change the state or ownership of an NFT are handled by this on-chain program, which is written in Rust. The AIW3 backend and frontend are responsible for calling these on-chain functions in response to user actions.

### Mapping User Operations to On-Chain Interactions

The AIW3 system interacts with the Solana blockchain in two ways: by calling custom-built smart contract functions for its unique business logic, and by utilizing standard Solana programs (like the SPL Token program) for common tasks.

| User Operation                  | On-Chain Interaction            | Interaction Type                | Description |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| **Unlocking an Equity NFT**     | `unlock_tier(level)`            | **Custom Smart Contract**       | The core progression function. The AIW3 backend first verifies off-chain criteria (trading volume). If met, it authorizes the user to call this function. The program then performs on-chain checks: verifies ownership of the required *bound* Badge NFTs, confirms the user is unlocking the next sequential level, transfers the CGas fee, and mints the new Equity NFT directly into the `Active` state by calling the SPL Token program. |
| **Binding a Badge NFT**         | `bind_badge(badge_nft_mint)`    | **Custom Smart Contract**       | A prerequisite for unlocking higher tiers. The user initiates this action for a Badge NFT they own. The program verifies the user's ownership of the `badge_nft_mint` and records it in a user-specific on-chain state account, marking it as "bound" and available for `unlock_tier` checks. |
| **Activating an NFT**           | `activate_nft(nft_mint)`        | **Custom Smart Contract**       | Used for special, airdropped NFTs (like the Breeder Reward NFT) that are minted in an `Inactive` state. The program verifies the user owns the `nft_mint` and flips its on-chain status from `Inactive` to `Active`, enabling its benefits. |
| **Claiming an NFT**             | `claim_reward(reward_id)`       | **Custom Smart Contract**       | A system-controlled minting function for special awards. The AIW3 backend whitelists a user for a `reward_id`. The user then calls this function, which verifies their eligibility on-chain and mints the corresponding NFT to their wallet in an `Inactive` state. |
| **Selling/Transferring an NFT** | Standard `spl-token` transfer   | **Standard Solana Program**     | This is **not** a function of the AIW3 program. It is a standard Solana token transfer handled by external marketplace programs. The AIW3 backend must **monitor** the blockchain for transfer events involving its NFTs to reactively update user benefits and badges. |

### System Architecture and Technology Stack

The following diagram illustrates the interaction between the user, AIW3's off-chain services, and the on-chain Solana programs.

```

**Interaction Flow:**
1.  The **User** interacts with the **Frontend**.
2.  The **Frontend** sends requests to the **AIW3 Backend**.
3.  For operations like unlocking, the **Backend** first verifies off-chain data (e.g., cumulative trade volume from its **Database**).
4.  If conditions are met, the **Backend** constructs a transaction to call the appropriate on-chain program and sends it via the **Solana JSON RPC API**.
5.  The transaction is processed by the network, executing functions in either the **Custom AIW3 Program** (for business logic) or the **Standard SPL Token Program** (for simple transfers).
6.  The **Backend** also monitors the blockchain via the **RPC API** to read on-chain state and react to events like NFT transfers.

#### Core Technology Stack

-   **Rust:** The programming language used to write secure and high-performance Solana smart contracts.
-   **Anchor Framework:** A framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime that simplifies writing Rust-based smart contracts by handling boilerplate, providing a domain-specific language (DSL), and ensuring security best practices.
-   **Solana Program Library (SPL):** A collection of pre-audited, standard on-chain programs for common tasks. We will primarily use the `spl-token` program for creating, minting, and transferring NFTs, which are a type of SPL token.
-   **Solana JSON RPC API:** The primary interface for off-chain clients (like the AIW3 backend) to interact with the Solana blockchain‚Äîsending transactions and querying on-chain data.

### On-Chain Data Models

To execute the business logic described in this manual, the AIW3 smart contract must store and manage state on the Solana blockchain. This is achieved through several custom on-chain accounts (data structures). The following diagram illustrates the relationships between these core data models.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    title On-Chain Data Model
    USER {
        PublicKey publicKey "User's Wallet (Owner)"
    }

    USER_NFT_STATE {
        PublicKey owner PK "FK to User"
        int current_level
        PublicKey active_nft_mint
        list_PublicKey bound_badges
    }

    TIER_CONFIGURATION {
        PublicKey authority "Admin Key"
        int unlock_fee_cgas
        list_TierRequirement tier_requirements
    }

    AIW3_PROGRAM {
        string program_id "Program Address"
    }

    SPL_TOKEN_PROGRAM {
        string program_id "Standard Program"
    }

    USER ||--o{ USER_NFT_STATE : "has one"
    AIW3_PROGRAM }o--|| TIER_CONFIGURATION : "is governed by"
    AIW3_PROGRAM }o--o{ USER_NFT_STATE : "manages"
    AIW3_PROGRAM ..> SPL_TOKEN_PROGRAM : "invokes"
```

#### Data Model Descriptions

##### UserNftState Account
This is the most critical account for tracking a user's progress. A unique `UserNftState` account is created for each user who interacts with the NFT system, typically as a Program Derived Address (PDA) derived from the user's public key.
-   **`owner: PublicKey`**: The wallet address of the user this state belongs to.
-   **`current_level: u8`**: The user's current active Equity NFT level (e.g., 1 for "Tech Chicken"). A value of 0 indicates they hold no Equity NFT.
-   **`active_nft_mint: PublicKey`**: The mint address of the user's currently active Equity NFT. This allows for quick verification of their highest-tier NFT.
-   **`bound_badges: Vec<PublicKey>`**: A list of the mint addresses of the Badge NFTs the user has permanently bound to their account to meet upgrade requirements.

##### TierConfiguration Account
This is a singleton account (only one exists per program deployment) that acts as the global configuration for the entire Equity NFT system. It is controlled by a central authority key.
-   **`authority: PublicKey`**: The wallet address with permission to update this configuration.
-   **`unlock_fee_cgas: u64`**: The amount of CGas required for a user to execute the `unlock_tier` function.
-   **`tier_requirements: Vec<TierRequirement>`**: A list defining the upgrade conditions for each level. Each `TierRequirement` struct would contain:
    -   `level: u8`: The tier this requirement is for.
    -   `required_badges: u8`: The number of badges that must be in the `UserNftState.bound_badges` vector to unlock this level.

#### Model Relationships and Interaction

-   **User and State:** Each **User** (identified by their wallet `PublicKey`) has a one-to-one relationship with a `UserNftState` account. This account acts as their profile within the AIW3 NFT system.
-   **State and Badges:** The `UserNftState` account holds a list of `bound_badges`, representing a one-to-many relationship. This list is checked by the smart contract during an upgrade attempt.
-   **Program Governance:** The `TierConfiguration` account governs the rules of the **AIW3 Program**. When a user calls `unlock_tier`, the program reads this account to verify the fee and badge requirements for the target level.
-   **Interaction with Standard Programs:** The custom **AIW3 Program** does not handle token transfers itself. When `unlock_tier` is successful, it makes a cross-program invocation to the standard **SPL Token Program** to mint the new Equity NFT to the user's wallet. This separates our unique business logic from standard token operations.

### Feature Implementation Strategy: On-Chain vs. Off-Chain

This section clarifies which features are implemented within the custom smart contract versus those handled by off-chain components (backend/frontend). This distinction is critical for security, performance, and cost.

#### Guiding Principles

-   **On-Chain (Smart Contract):** Must be used for actions that change ownership, modify core state, or enforce rules that require decentralized trust. The contract is the ultimate arbiter of "who owns what" and "what the rules are."
-   **Off-Chain (Backend/Frontend):** Should be used for reading/displaying data, complex calculations, and business logic that doesn't require on-chain enforcement (e.g., applying a fee discount). It is cheaper, faster, and more flexible to do this off-chain.

#### Feature Breakdown

##### Must-Have On-Chain Features (Smart Contract)
These functions are non-negotiable and form the core of the trustless system.

| Feature / Function              | Rationale & Impact on State

a new NFT. This is the core state-changing function. Rationale: Must be on-chain to prevent unauthorized level-ups and ensure atomic updates.
-   **`bind_badge`**: Adds a badge's mint address to the `bound_badges` vector. Rationale: The list of bound badges is a critical prerequisite for `unlock_tier` and must be stored in a trustless on-chain account.
-   **`activate_nft`**: Flips an on-chain status flag from `Inactive` to `Active`. Rationale: The active status determines real-time benefits and must be publicly verifiable.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             -   **Calculating Trading Volume**: The backend runs complex queries on its MySQL database to sum up a user's historical trading volume. Rationale: This calculation is too computationally expensive and data-intensive to perform on-chain.
-   **Displaying NFT Images/Metadata**: The frontend fetches metadata and images from IPFS via a public gateway. Rationale: Storing large files like images on-chain is prohibitively expensive. IPFS provides a cost-effective decentralized alternative.
-   **Applying Fee Discounts**: The backend reads a user's active NFT level from the blockchain, looks up the corresponding discount in its own configuration, and applies it to the user's transactions. Rationale: The discount logic can be updated easily off-chain without requiring a smart contract redeployment.

This section details how the frontend application interacts with the backend services and the Solana blockchain to deliver the user-facing NFT experience.

#### 1. Personal Center - Displaying User NFTs

The Personal Center is the user's primary interface for viewing their NFT collection. The frontend renders this view by orchestrating calls to both the AIW3 backend and the Solana network.

*![Personal Center UI](..//aiw3-prototypes/AIW3%20Distribution%20System/VIP%20Level%20Plan/7.%20Personal%20Center.png)*

**Flow:**
1.  **Frontend Request**: When the user navigates to their Personal Center, the frontend sends a request to the AIW3 backend with the user's authenticated ID.
2.  **Backend Verification**: The backend retrieves the user's wallet address and queries the Solana blockchain for all NFTs associated with that wallet that have the verified AIW3 creator address.
3.  **Metadata Fetch**: For each valid NFT found, the backend fetches the off-chain JSON metadata from IPFS.
4.  **API Response**: The backend aggregates this information (NFT level, image URI, benefits) and sends it back to the frontend.
5.  **Render View**: The frontend uses this data to display the user's "Unlocked" NFTs and identifies the next "Unlockable" tier based on the user's current level.

#### 2. NFT Synthesis (Upgrade) Flow

"Synthesis" is the user-facing term for the NFT upgrade process, which involves burning an old NFT to mint a new one. The frontend guides the user through this, while the backend manages the complex blockchain interactions.

*![Synthesis UI](..//aiw3-prototypes/Personal%20Center/Personal%20Homepage/4.%20Synthesis.png)*

**Flow:**
1.  **Eligibility Check**: The user clicks the "Synthesize" button. The frontend calls a dedicated backend endpoint to verify if the user meets the transaction volume and badge requirements for the next tier.
2.  **User Confirmation**: If eligible, the frontend displays a confirmation popup. The user must approve the transaction in their connected wallet (e.g., Phantom or Solflare). This signature authorizes the burning of their current NFT.
3.  **Backend Process**: The backend initiates the burn transaction, waits for blockchain confirmation, and then proceeds to mint the new, higher-level NFT to the user's wallet.
4.  **Success Notification**: Once the new NFT is minted, the backend notifies the frontend, which displays a success message to the user.

*![Synthesis Success UI](..//aiw3-prototypes/Personal%20Center/Personal%20Homepage/5.%20Lv2%20Synthesis%20Success.png)*

#### 3. Pre-Synthesis Activation

Before a user can initiate the synthesis process, they may need to complete an activation step. This is triggered by a popup that ensures the user is ready and has met preliminary requirements.

*![Activation Popup](..//aiw3-prototypes/Personal%20Center/Personal%20Homepage/7.%20Trigger%20Activation%20Popup.png)*

**Flow:**
1.  The frontend detects that a user is eligible for an upgrade but has not completed a necessary preliminary action (e.g., confirming their wallet).
2.  A modal popup is displayed, prompting the user to "Activate" their status.
3.  This interaction is a client-side check that unlocks the "Synthesize" button, acting as a gate before the more resource-intensive backend eligibility check is called.

#### 4. System Notifications and Messaging

The system uses asynchronous messages to keep the user informed of important events, such as receiving a new badge or a successful synthesis.

*![System Messages](..//aiw3-prototypes/AIW3%20Distribution%20System/VIP%20Level%20Plan/11.%20System%20Messages.png)*

**Flow:**
1.  The backend performs an action that requires user notification (e.g., an airdrop is completed).
2.  A message is stored in a user-specific notification table in the database.
3.  The frontend periodically polls a notifications endpoint and displays an indicator for unread messages.
4.  The user can view the full message history in their inbox.

#### 5. Public Profile View

A user's NFTs and badges are visible to others on their Community Mini-Homepage, which serves as their public-facing profile.

*![Other User's View](..//aiw3-prototypes/Personal%20Center/Personal%20Homepage/9.%20Other%20Users%20View%20Homepage.png)*

**Flow:**
1.  A user navigates to another user's profile page.
2.  The frontend requests the public profile data for the target user from the backend.
3.  The backend follows the same logic as the Personal Center (querying the blockchain for NFTs and badges) but only returns publicly visible information.
4.  The frontend renders the public view, showcasing the user's collection.

## Implementation Guide

### Recommended Approach: Metadata Attributes with IPFS Distribution

Use Metaplex standard where on-chain metadata contains URI pointing to IPFS-hosted JSON with level data, while images are sourced from backend `assets/images` directory and distributed via IPFS for decentralized partner access.

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Decentralized access via standard metadata queries
- ‚úÖ Authenticity verification through on-chain creator field
- ‚úÖ Full ecosystem compatibility
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective hybrid approach
- ‚úÖ Leverages proven Metaplex standard
- ‚úÖ Centralized source management with decentralized distribution

**Technical Details**:
- **Source Storage**: Backend `assets/images` directory for image management
- **Distribution**: IPFS via Pinata for decentralized, content-addressed storage
- **Authenticity**: On-chain creator verification via AIW3 System Wallet address
- **Compatibility**: Standard NFT tools and marketplace support

### Minting Process Implementation

**Step-by-Step Minting Flow**:

1. **Transaction Volume Verification**
   - Query user's total transaction volume from MySQL database
   - Determine highest qualified NFT level based on volume thresholds
   - Verify user doesn't already possess NFT of that level or higher
   - Check for any pending minting operations for the user

2. **Image Preparation**
   - Read source image from `assets/images/{level}.png`
   - Validate image format and size
   - Upload image to IPFS via Pinata
   - Obtain IPFS hash for image

3. **Metadata Creation**
   - Create JSON metadata structure
   - Include IPFS image URI in `image` field
   - Add level data to `attributes` array
   - Include creator information

4. **Metadata Upload**
   - Upload JSON metadata to IPFS via Pinata
   - Obtain IPFS hash for metadata
   - Verify metadata accessibility via gateway

5. **NFT Minting**
   - Create Solana mint account
   - Create user's Associated Token Account
   - Mint single token to user's ATA
   - Create Metaplex metadata account with IPFS JSON URI

6. **Verification**
   - Confirm on-chain metadata creation
   - Verify IPFS content accessibility
   - Test partner verification flow

## NFT Upgrade and Burn Process

The upgrade process is a critical system function that combines on-chain (Solana) and off-chain (AIW3 Backend) operations. It is designed to be atomic and verifiable, ensuring system integrity.

### Invalidation Strategy: User-Controlled Burning
The recommended approach is **User-Controlled Burning**. The user executes `burn` and `closeAccount` transactions directly from their wallet. This method provides definitive, on-chain proof of destruction and aligns with Web3 principles of user autonomy.

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ **Unambiguous Proof**: The closure of the Associated Token Account (ATA) is definitive on-chain evidence that the NFT has been destroyed.
- ‚úÖ **Trustless Verification**: The AIW3 System Wallet can programmatically verify the burn by checking that the ATA no longer exists.
- ‚úÖ **Solana Standards**: This approach correctly follows the SPL Token program's intended lifecycle.
- ‚úÖ **User Empowerment**: Users maintain full control over their assets and can reclaim the SOL rent from the closed account.

**Verification Method**: The system confirms the burn by querying the ATA's address. If `getAccountInfo(ataAddress)` returns `null`, the burn is verified.

### Upgrade Sequence Workflow

The following diagram illustrates the technical sequence of events during an NFT upgrade.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend as AIW3 Frontend
    participant Wallet as Phantom/Solflare
    participant Backend as AIW3 Backend
    participant Solana as Solana Blockchain

    %% Step 1: Eligibility Check
    User->>Frontend: Click "Check Eligibility"
    Frontend->>Backend: GET /api/eligibility-check
    Backend->>Backend: Verify transaction volume & badges for user
    Backend-->>Frontend: {"eligible": true, "targetLevel": "Level 2"}
    Frontend->>User: Display "You are eligible to upgrade!"

    %% Step 2: Burn Initiation
    User->>Frontend: Click "Burn to Upgrade"
    Frontend->>Wallet: Request signature for burn transaction
    User->>Wallet: Approve Transaction
    Wallet->>Solana: Submit burn & close ATA transaction
    Solana-->>Wallet: Transaction Confirmed
    Wallet-->>Frontend: Burn transaction successful

    %% Step 3: Burn Verification
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /api/request-upgrade {burnTx: "..."}
    Backend->>Solana: getAccountInfo(user_L1_NFT_ata_address)
    Solana-->>Backend: null (Confirms ATA is closed)
    note right of Backend: ‚úÖ On-chain verification success!

    %% Step 4: New NFT Minting
    Backend->>Solana: Mint Level 2 NFT to new ATA for User
    Solana-->>Backend: Mint Successful
    Backend-->>Frontend: {"upgradeStatus": "complete"}
    Frontend->>User: Display "Upgrade Complete! You now have Level 2 NFT."
```

### Upgrade Implementation Pseudo-Code

**Transaction Volume Verification (Backend)**
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for AIW3 platform transaction volume verification
async function verifyTransactionVolumeRequirement(
    userWallet: PublicKey, 
    targetLevel: string
): Promise<{ qualified: boolean; currentVolume: number; requiredVolume: number }> {
    
    // Volume thresholds are sourced from business logic configuration
    const volumeThresholds = getVolumeThresholds();
    
    // Query AIW3 platform transaction history
    const userTransactionHistory = await getAIW3TransactionHistory(userWallet);
    const totalVolume = calculateTotalVolume(userTransactionHistory);
    const requiredVolume = volumeThresholds[targetLevel];
    
    return {
        qualified: totalVolume >= requiredVolume,
        currentVolume: totalVolume,
        requiredVolume: requiredVolume
    };
}
```

**Burn Verification (Backend)**
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for AIW3 system verification
async function verifyNFTBurnCompletion(oldNftMintAddress: PublicKey, userWallet: PublicKey): Promise<boolean> {
    // Check if the user's ATA for this mint still exists
    const ata = await getAssociatedTokenAddress(oldNftMintAddress, userWallet);
    const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(ata);
    
    return accountInfo === null; // Account closed = burn complete
}
```

### Implementation Design Choices

| Verification Type | Approach | Description | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Transaction Volume** | **Platform Database Query** | Query AIW3 internal database for user transaction history. | Provides real-time, comprehensive data. While centralized, it is the authoritative source for platform-specific activity. |
| **NFT Burn Status** | **Polling after User Signal** | User's frontend signals the backend after submitting the burn transaction. Backend then polls the ATA address until `getAccountInfo` returns `null`. | Balances implementation simplicity with near real-time verification without requiring a complex chain-monitoring service. |

## Detailed Process Flows

### Partner Verification Process

**Data Flow for Authentication**:

```
1. User presents Wallet Address
   ‚Üì
2. Partner queries Solana for Token Accounts owned by wallet
   ‚Üì
3. Filter for tokens with supply = 1 (NFTs) ‚Üí Get Mint Address
   ‚Üì
4. Find On-Chain Metadata PDA associated with Mint
   ‚Üì
5. Verify Authenticity: Check creators array for AIW3 System Wallet public key (verified: true)
   ‚Üì
6. Get Rich Data: Read uri field from on-chain metadata
   ‚Üì
7. Fetch Off-Chain JSON from IPFS URI (via Pinata gateway)
   ‚Üì
8. Extract Level Data: Parse attributes array in off-chain JSON for "Level" trait
   ‚Üì
9. Retrieve Image: Get image URI from JSON metadata (IPFS URI)
   ‚Üì
10. Display Image: Access image directly from IPFS via gateway
   ‚Üì
11. Business Context: Level represents user's transaction volume tier at time of minting
```

### Volume Qualification Verification Process

**Pre-Minting Volume Check Flow**:

```
1. User requests NFT minting for specific level
   ‚Üì
2. System queries MySQL: SELECT SUM(transaction_amount) FROM user_transactions WHERE user_id = ? AND status = 'completed'
   ‚Üì
3. Calculate qualified level based on volume thresholds
   ‚Üì
4. Compare requested level with qualified level
   ‚Üì
5. Check existing NFT ownership: Query blockchain for user's current NFTs
   ‚Üì
6. Verify no duplicate level minting
   ‚Üì
7. Authorize or deny minting request based on qualification
   ‚Üì
8. If approved: Proceed to image preparation and IPFS upload
   ‚Üì
9. If denied: Return qualification error with current volume status
```

**Volume Verification Error Scenarios**:
- **Insufficient Volume**: User requests level above their transaction volume
- **Duplicate Level**: User already owns NFT of requested level
- **Database Error**: Unable to calculate transaction volume
- **Pending Operation**: User has existing minting operation in progress

### Image Distribution Flow

**From Source to Third-Party Access**:

```
Backend assets/images Directory
         ‚Üì
    [AIW3 Minting Process]
         ‚Üì
    Upload to IPFS via Pinata
         ‚Üì
    IPFS Content Hash Generated
         ‚Üì
    Include in JSON Metadata
         ‚Üì
    [Partner Verification Process]
         ‚Üì
    Query JSON from IPFS
         ‚Üì
    Extract Image IPFS URI
         ‚Üì
    Access Image from IPFS Gateway
```

## Terminologies

This section defines the core concepts used throughout this document.

-   **NFT (Non-Fungible Token):** A unique digital certificate of ownership for an asset, stored on a blockchain.
    -   **Analogy:** Think of it as a digital deed or a one-of-a-kind collectible card. While anyone can have a copy of a digital image, the NFT is the proof of owning the original. It's like having the artist's signature on a print, certifying it as authentic.

-   **Equity NFTs:** The official name for the platform's primary NFTs that represent user status and benefits. They are organized into different **Levels** (or **Tiers**).
    -   **Synonyms:** You may see these referred to as **Tiered NFTs**, **Tier NFTs**, or **Level NFTs** in different contexts. "Equity NFT" is the canonical term for the main progression NFTs.
    -   **Progression Model:** The primary way to acquire higher-level Equity NFTs is by meeting cumulative **trading volume** thresholds and binding a required number of **Badge NFTs**.
    -   **Utility:** While each token is a unique non-fungible asset on the blockchain, its utility is fungible within its tier. This means any Lv.2 NFT provides the exact same benefits as any other Lv.2 NFT.
    -   **Analogy:** This is similar to a customer loyalty program (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold status) or leveling up a character in a game. Each new tier provides enhanced status and perks, with the top tier granting equity-like benefits. Your "Gold" membership card is unique to you, but it gives you the same benefits as every other "Gold" member.


-   **Synthesis:** The official user-facing term for the process of upgrading an Equity NFT to the next level. This action involves meeting specific criteria (like trading volume and owning Badge NFTs) and results in the user acquiring a higher-tier NFT. While the underlying technical process may be referred to as an 'upgrade' or 'unlock,' the user interacts with this feature as **Synthesis**.
    -   **Analogy:** This is like crafting a more powerful item from a weaker one in a game. The user gathers the required materials (trading volume, badges) and then initiates the synthesis to create the next-level asset.

-   **CGas:** A platform-specific token required to pay for certain transactions, such as unlocking a new Equity NFT tier.
    -   **Analogy:** Similar to "gas" on Ethereum, CGas is the fuel for specific platform operations.

-   **Solana:** A high-performance blockchain network on which the AIW3 NFTs are built, recorded, and traded.
    -   **Analogy:** If an NFT is a valuable package, Solana is the global, super-fast, and secure courier service that handles its delivery and tracks its ownership history transparently.

-   **Unlockable State:** A state where a user has met the conditions to acquire an NFT but has not yet claimed or minted it. This requires a user action to complete the acquisition.
    -   **Analogy:** This is like having a coupon you are eligible for but haven't redeemed yet. You need to take the step to present the coupon to get the item.

-   **Micro Badge:** A small, icon-like representation of a user's highest-level NFT, displayed on their profile and in community spaces to signify their status.
    -   **Analogy:** This is like a digital lapel pin or a rank insignia on a uniform, quickly communicating a person's level or achievements to others.

-   **Special NFTs (e.g., Breeder Reward NFT):** These are distinct NFTs awarded for specific achievements, such as winning a trading competition. They are acquired through airdrops, not synthesis, and may have their own unique benefits. They are separate from the main Equity NFT progression ladder.
