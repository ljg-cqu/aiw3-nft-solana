1.  Save the script as `inspect-account.js` in the `poc/solana-nft-burn-mint` directory.
2.  Run the script from the command line, providing the account address as an argument:

    ```bash
    node inspect-account.js <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
    ```

    Replace `<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with the address of the account you want to inspect.
